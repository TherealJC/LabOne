# LabOne

Repo for Lab One (Index.js contains my practice work from 2/3/20 AND what is
required for lab one    
  

example.js and randomtask.js are from practising in class on 3/3/2020 and not 
related to this lab.  
I'm just using this as a practice page)

WHAT HAVE I LEARNT?  
: A LOT about using JavaScript, commands, how to make an index.js folder,  
how to use console.log to display in the terminal, how to make variables, how to solve equations using set variables.  
Instead of writing a huge amount of code here, you can see all my work and progress in index.js using Node index.js  
and by looking at all the script ofcourse :)  

WHY HAVE I LEARNT THIS?  
:Because JavaScript can be used to create websites from scatch, and is a core skill of any web developer.  
A crucial skill that is used in many tech jobs (Web Developer, Freelancer)  
Roughly a third of recruitment website jobs require you to have knowledge and experience with JS  

HOW HAVE I LEARNT THIS?  
:A LOT of playing around with different commands in the index.js folder.  
Instead of using the internet when i had a problem, I tried to just figure it out by trial and error.  
The help messages were quite helpful though, now that I am getting used to using git/node  
i am able to understand more and more about the problems I encounter simply by reading through  
the message and seeing where the code is going wrong (I will list some problems i faced at the end)  

WHAT DO I KNOW NOW THAT YOU DIDNâ€™T KNOW BEFORE?  
:Same as what have i learnt, how to use Node, setting variables, solving equations.  

WHAT IS THE POINT? WHAT WILL I DO TO REMEMBER THIS LEARNING?  
:Continue practising with JS, continue studying on the internet,
as I learn something new, to try it for myself in Vscode, and then play around with the code to understand it better.  

WHAT NEW UNDERSTANDING/SKILLS HAVE YOU GAINED?  
:I didn't know anything about JavaScript besides the name. Today I have learned what feels like a lot,  
but i know that it's only the very beginners intro to JS so far.

WHAT ARE THE REAL LIFE/WORK APPLICATIONS?  
:You can create websites, games, apps  

WHAT WILL I DO TO FILL IN ANY GAPS IN MY UNDERSTANDING?  
:Read over basic JS and watch some videos explaining further uses of JS  

Challenges I faced:  
While trying to think of a code that would show the question, and the result on one line (Without using commas)  
I faced many errors, when I tried to show my work in the terminal by using "Node index.js"  
In the terminal, it showed an error message instead of my work, but it would show me why it wasn't working just below  
with nice little ^^^ arrows where the script was incorrect. With a bit of experimenting i was able to fix it (See index.js)  

Another challenge was when I tried to commit my changes, it came up with the error  
"git: fatal unable to auto-detect email address", thankfully, the hints below helped out again, along with some quick  
research. This was resolved by using  
git config --global user.email "MyEmailHere"  
Although now my question is, why does this occur ? Why do you need an Email ? Or did i go wrong somewhere ?

After Tuesdays class, I have some new challenges that I faced:  
We had quite a lot of trouble trying to figure out the brackets, we had our equation set out, but figuring out  
where to actually put the brackets was a mystery, Me, Rory, and Kyren managed to kind of figure it out  
but there is still confusion there, I will do more study on JS.
