//Setting a constant
const firstname = "Jamie";

// var firstname = "Rory"; (Wont work here, because firstname is set to constant)
console.log(firstname);

//Let will LET you set a VAR that can be changed later in the code
let lastname = "Crowther";
console.log(firstname + " " + lastname);

//Now with Let changed, it will show the old Let above, and the new Let below
lastname = "Changes";

console.log(lastname);

//Combined together
console.log(firstname + " " + lastname);
